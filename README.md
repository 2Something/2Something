#### Welcome to the Homepage of ChipTypeScript!

- 👋 Hi, I’m ChipTS (TypeScript)!
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, and developing for others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NPM Package Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game dev mostly, but I can work on anything!
- 📫 You can reach me @ kalibstory.2010@outlook.com or @<a href='https://discordlookup.com/user/1152233237079400488' target='_blank' alt='1152233237079400488'>crunchedcookies</a>
- 😠 Pronouns: I am MALE
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming when I was only around 6, making games for roblox, but now I find myself more interested in projects for friends or developing websites.
- ❗I know most programming languages, so don't be afraid to ask me for a special project. I am always learning more, but I don't know most common server handling languages.
